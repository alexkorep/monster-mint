I'm making on an Mint Monsters game where you defeat cute monster and win candies.
It contains:
1. Levels. Each level contain a background, 10 monsters: 9 normal monsters and a boss.
2. Monsters. Each monster has a name, a picture, initial health and current health
3. Candies. Each monster has a number of candies. When you defeat a monster, you get the candies.
4. Upgrades. You can use candies to buy upgrades. Each upgrade has a name, a level, a picture, a price, and damage multiplier per level. You can buy the next level of the upgrade if you have enough candies.
A monster is displayed on the screen. You can click on the monster to attack it. When you attack a monster, its health decreases. When its health reaches 0, you defeat the monster and get the candies. You can use the candies to buy upgrades. When you buy an upgrade, the damage of your attack increases.
